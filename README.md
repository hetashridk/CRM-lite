# Group Project 1 - TBD | Interactive Front-End Application
### From Scratch — to build a CRM-lite
<br>

## Description

In this group project we have created a web application from scratch! 

A CRM-lite for a `<specific client>` in a `<specific industry>` in order to automate and organize their project portfolios, create adhoc projects, fill out forms for project details, generate form results in pdf files, and take/upload pictures `[to google drive perhaps]`.

This app uses 3rd party API's such as google drive, google calendar, google maps, as well as the weather forecast APIs. 


This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that we wrote and polished `[ehem! debuged]` as a team. It has a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. 

Way to go TEAM 4 🙏👍
