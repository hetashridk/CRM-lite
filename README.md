# Group Project 1 - TBD | Interactive Front-End Application
### From Scratch ‚Äî to build a CRM-lite
<br>

## Description

In this group project we have created a web application from scratch! 

A CRM-lite is a  Green Grass Lawn Care Services for employees to book appointment in order to have fastest lawn services and  provide excellent customer lawn care services experience. This app uses 3rd party API's such Weather API and Canadian holiday api.This API is used to check if weather is sunny on appoitment date and Canadian Holiday is used to check to make sure there is no Canadian Fedral Holiday on the day of appointment because we are off that day
his app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that we wrote and polished together as a team. It has a clean, polished, and responsive user interface.
